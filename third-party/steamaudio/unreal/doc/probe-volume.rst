Steam Audio Probe Volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A volume in which sound probes can be generated. When baking reflections, reverb, or pathing, baked data is stored in one or more probe volumes.

Each probe volume contains one or more probes within its volume. You can control the size and shape of this volume using Unreal's translate, rotate, and scale tools, just like any other volume actor.

Asset
    Reference to the asset that contains the exported baked data for this probe volume. Automatically generated by Steam Audio.

Generation Type
    Specifies how probes should be generated and placed within this volume.

    - *Centroid*. Places a single probe at the center of the volume.

    - *Uniform Floor*. Places probes at a specified height above the floor with a specified horizontal spacing between probes. The "floor" is defined as any geometry that would intersect rays cast within the volume and parallel to the -y axis in the local coordinate system of the probe volume.

Horizontal Spacing
    The horizontal distance (in meters) between adjacent probes. Only used if **Generation Type** is **Uniform Floor**.

Height Above Floor
    The height (in meters) above the floor at which probes should be placed. Only used if **Generation Type** is **Uniform Floor**.

Generate Probes
    Generates probes within the volume.

Clear Baked Data
    Deletes all baked data stored within the probe volume.

Bake Pathing
    Starts baking pathing data for this probe volume.

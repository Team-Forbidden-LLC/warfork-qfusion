Steam Audio Dynamic Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tags the actor it's attached to, and all of its descendants, as dynamic geometry.

Any Steam Audio Geometry components found in this actor, or one of its descendants, are exported as a single dynamic object. However, if one of the descendants contains a Steam Audio Dynamic Object component of its own, then *its* descendants are treated as a separate dynamic object.

At run-time, any changes made to the transform of the actor to which the Steam Audio Dynamic Object component has been attached will automatically be passed to Steam Audio.

.. note::
    
    Changes made to the transforms of descendants of the Steam Audio Dynamic Object will *not* be passed to Steam Audio. The Dynamic Object and all its descendants must move/animate as a rigid body.

Asset

Export Dynamic Object
    Exports the dynamic object to an asset. When doing this for the first time, you will be prompted for a file name and directory under which to save the asset.

Export Dynamic Object As OBJ
    Exports the dynamic object to a .OBJ file. This is intended for debugging purposes.
